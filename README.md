#  Cancer classification
 

## Project Overview
   The objective of this project was to classify breast tumors as benign (B) or malignant (M) using the Wisconsin Breast Cancer Dataset. The project included:
     Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
     Model training and evaluation
     Performance comparison of multiple algorithms

# Data Exploration
  Initial analysis focused on understanding the distribution of features.

    The features are right-skewed and vary significantly in scale.
    Some features like V4 and V29 have wide ranges, while others are tightly clustered.
    Standardization or normalization is recommended for distance-based models.
    
# Feature Distributions

  Models Used
  I trained and evaluated the following machine learning models:
  
    Logistic Regression
    K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    Gaussian Naive Bayes
    Random Forest
    Gradient Boosting
    Support Vector Classifier (SVC)

# Performance Evaluation
   Confusion Matrices
